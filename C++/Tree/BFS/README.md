Breadth First Search of Tree:

In BFS traversal, we will print the values of nodes level wise, i.e first root will be printed, then it's child and so on.

For this type of traversal, we can use queue, which follows first in first out approach. Address of root node will be stored in the queue then at every traversal child nodes of node present at the front of queue will be inserted in queue and front node will be printed and popped from queue. This traversal will take place untill queue is empty.
