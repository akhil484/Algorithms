# Algorithms
For the pull request to be merged successfully,add the neat and clean python code for the algorithms which are not present in the repo.Each contribution should have a folder name same as of Algorithm name and each folder should consists of main.py file along with a readme.md file explaining the algorithm.
eg. for DFS algo make a folder DFS.Inside that folder there should be two files main.py and readme.md .
